# pylogix-tester

This utility is made to test [pylogix by Dustin Roeder](https://github.com/dmroeder/pylogix)

Download [latest release](https://github.com/kodaman2/pylogix-tester/releases/latest) for Windows, it runs on both x86 and x64. This utility will ensure you have connection to the plc, and can read one controller tag and program tag. Follow the prompts.

# Running the py script

If you choose to run the python script, you need the following dependencies:

- pip install git+https://github.com/dmroeder/pylogix
- pip install ping3

> I recommend using the latest, but if for whatever reason you are using pylogix 0.3.7 or below, then use the script on [tag v1.0.2](https://github.com/kodaman2/pylogix-tester/tree/v1.0.2). Pylogix Tester script and compiled on v1.0.3 are using pylogix 0.4.0.

If you are using the compiled exe, then don't pay too much attention to the versions mentioned above.
